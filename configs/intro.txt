My name is Kaixiang Chen (Chinese name: 陈恺翔). Currently, I am a storekeeper in my hometown, Hui'an, Fujian, China. Before that, I received the B.Eng. Degree in Chongqing University (CQU) in China. 

I am interested in multi-robot, especially air-ground collaboration. Also, my research interest is including aerial manipulation.

In my spare time, I am a big fan of badminton. During my undergraduate, I joined the badminton association in CQU, called Xiangyu Badminton Association. Even off campus, I still keep up my badminton habit.
